CCF (Community Construction Fundraiser)

This project allows users to create an account to be able to donate to various construction projects in their community or even country.  

This will allow government funded projects, private projects, approved preliminary projects, ongoing projects, or delayed projects to be funded by public donations.

Currently, only the homepage and the sign up page are developed so this project is not fully developed yet.

This project is not responsive on iPhone 5's or smaller and all mobile phones tilted sideways, it is however responsive on tall screen phones and tablets.
